#### Software-Engineering for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SECPPS)
# Workshop 2024/2 -- Community Edition
#### OFFIS, Oldenburg, May 21st-23rd, 2024

The community edition of the [SECPPS workshop series](/) focuses on a constructive and
open exchange process to guide industry-relevant research and to help
transferring technological advances from research into industry. We welcome
academic and industrial participants to come together to summarize existing
work, identify new challenges, and discuss solution strategies. In a
co-creative process, we want to find ways to address emerging topics and
bring modern software engineering into industrial usage.

You are welcome to propose on-topic talks of maximum 30 minutes to present to
the audience. There are multiple slots available for you to present recent
advances or topics you are working on. The remainder of the workshop will
proceed in the [Barcamp](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcamp) format, with
a strong desire to create actionable output for the near future.

For more information regarding the workshop, especially for people who are
interested to attend for the first time, please contact [Jörg Walter](https://www.offis.de/en/offis/person/joerg-walter.html)
([joerg.walter@offis.de](mailto:joerg.walter@offis.de?subject=SECPPS24 Information)).

**Note:** A draft version of this invitation had a later date. If you saw
the draft, please note the current, final date of the event.

## Results

As usual, the workshop was a great success with lots of interesting discussions. Unexpectedly,
there were so many interesting topic pitches that we spontaneously recheduled, adding two more
barcamp slots. The viewpoints of our industrial visitors were well appreciated, and follow-up
activities have been initiated.

The barcamp results are available to all participants under the published link. Contact
([joerg.walter@offis.de](mailto:joerg.walter@offis.de?subject=SECPPS24 Information)) if you lost access to it.
