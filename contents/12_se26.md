# Workshop on Software Engineering for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SECPPS)

12th Meeting of the SECPPS Community, 5th edition co-located with the SE conference

## About 
Software plays an essential part in the efficient operation of modern production systems. While variability and complexity represent key challenges for cyber-physical production systems,  software design in production systems is still a neglected topic. The SECPPS workshop series aims to promote modern software engineering solutions to the challenges of cyber-physical production systems and foster interdisciplinary discussion.

This workshop edition is co-located with [SE 2026](https://se2026.inf.unibe.ch/en/).

## Organizers

  * Sandra Greiner (University of Southern Denmark, DK)
  * Stefan Klikovits (JKU Linz, AT)





## Call for Abstract Submission

Next to invited talks, we accept abstracts for talks in the broad area of software engineering for cyber-physical production systems. Please send them to the organizers by mail
